								<h3>Workshop Space</h3
									The workshop space in antidote is an open space designed for multiple use activities.  These include.
<ul><li>Movies. Everyone loves to go to the movies and be entertained.  Our Antidote to the movies is a small community oriented theater that's warm and intimate. Bring a cushion and make yourself at home.  Don't expect a Hollywood thriller at Antidote, in fact Antidote aims to be the exact opposite, a subtle reprogramming model aimed at making people more informed about the important issues we collectively face. On the 4th of September we will be showing <a href="http://youtu.be/O7ijukNzlUg">Forks over Knives</a> the quintessential movie on the state of the food system on this planet.  We would love to see you there.</br></br></li>
 <li>Yoga. Yoga in itâ€™s true form is practicing the <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/article/beginners/the-eight-limbs/">8 fold noble path</a>.  In this system Asana (Yoga posture) is only one requirement to reach Samadhi, a state of being one with the universe.  The practice of this kind of yoga is somewhat dead in the west, our goal is revive this ancient path to enlightenment.  All the teaching of Antidote yoga is given freely, without anything expected in return.  All yoga classes are funded purely from the donations of previous students and teachers. Any students are asked to humbly accept the Dana of other students while in the class and to give any donations with the thought in mind of the benefit another may receive from their practice of Yoga. </br></br>For poeple looking for a more casual pay as come classes we are also going to be teaching <a class="youtube" href="https://youtu.be/xECiTdgy9nE">AcroYoga.</a></br></br></li> 
 <li>Drumming by Oscar.  In terms of relaxing and "find the beat" in life it drumming often a very underrated tool.  Come and tap into your drumming potential with Oscar, all that is really required is to let go and find your inner rhythm. </li>
