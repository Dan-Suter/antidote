			<h2>Making a contribution</h3>
			<h3>Dāna One</h3>
			<p>In buddhist mediation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C4%81na">Dāna</a> is Generousity and in essense giving without expecting in return. Giving for the benefit of others. Dana One at Antidote is what we rocognise as the most valuble commodity at in our Business.  It is time given for free for the Benefit of others. We have enabled one person to benefit immensly by giving them a chance to experience true Dana and the one they serve to recieve the kindness in that transaction.
			</p>
			<h3>Dāna Trade</h3>
			<p>Dāna Trade is quite different to Dāna One.  While it still does not consitute a financial transaction, there may be tax implications to consider. Dana Trade can be thought of a type of TimeBank transaction so if your day job was accountancy and you wanted to offer accountancy services in Dana Trade for discounted Juices and Yoga Classes you may be libable for tax.  If however your skills are not something you would normally charge for your "time" is not taxable. Dana Trade is awesome as esentially you are trading time with others at a non-taxed equal rate, it our concept of an Antidote to our dependence on the current financial system. A piece of the puzzel for Jacque Fresco's Venus Project. A living example of people trading, caring and sharing in a way that benefits us in the most important ways. Our Health, our wellbeing.
			</p>
			<h3>Dollars</h3>
			<p>Good old fashioned dollars, yip kiwi ones with the Queen on it. Not that we see much of them these days most of the just seem to zip though the bank account at ever great speeds.  (especially those one from the supermarkets). Assume all tax and other implications but know that you helping to create a better world.
