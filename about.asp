			<h3>Antidote is about solutions</h3>
			<p>We live in a world beset by a variety of issues. Species are becoming extinct at alarming rates, forests are being cleared to make way for corporate profits and so many other aspects of the environment are being destroyed at an alarming rate. </p>
			<p>The health of the planets citizens are not much better off than that of the planet itself. Some <a href="http://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats">805 Million people</a> do not have enough food to lead a healthy active life.  While this has improved from 18.7% of the  <a href="http://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats">world's population being malnourished</a> in the 1990's to 11.3% in 2014, the obesity stats have ballooned.  In 1997 the New Zealand obesity rate in males was 17%. By 2013 this was 30%, for Maori Adults this number is 48% and for Pacific Islanders this is 68%. As kiwis we own the in-enviable title of coming 4th in the <a href="https://www.noo.org.uk/NOO_about_obesity/adult_obesity/international">obesity rankings</a>. Overall  <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/">Worldwide obesity</a> has more than doubled since 1980.</p>

			While fixing the planet is a little beyond the scope of this experiment here in New Brighton, we are keen to see if we can make a difference in our community. New Brighton is a beautiful seaside district of Christchurch, New Zealand. Brighton boasts some of the citys most interesting characters.  We even have our own full time <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NewBrightonUkeleleJam">pirates</a>, who are dedicated to creating happiness, a world renowed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttwxawO0ESc">sand artist</a>, we even have our own <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/710744462328950/">republic</a>. There is agenuine belief that we (our commmunity) can do things better. More on new bightons connected community  <a href="http://www.newbrightononline.nz">here</a>.
			Our Site Developer and Cheif Architect <a href="#">Daniel Suter</a> a local of New Brighton decided it would be a noble cause to build a website which records all the food it's patrons eat and drink and in turn provide patrons with nutritional feedback on what they are consuming. A kind of Bio Feedback if you will. If you wish to partake in this experience you can register to the website <a href="/register.asp">here</a> or on the link at the top of the page.

			<p>A wise man once said "Let food be thy medicine".  Many other wise individuals have echoed this truth over time.  One current such individual is George Mateljan of the George Mateljan Foundation.  George's website <a href="http://whfoods.com/foodstoc.php">whfoods.com </a> is the claimed to be the world's number one online reference for healthly food and recipies.  Max Gurson of the <a href=" https://gerson.org/gerpress/dr-max-gerson/">Gurson Institute</a> claimed to cure cancer from a diet of raw organic juices and vegetables. According to this technique by flooding the system with nutrients the blood becomes oxidated destorys the oppotunity for disease to take hold of the body. While there may be critics of this in the medical system, very few people would argue the point that if you eat healthy you will generally be more healthy.  At Antidote we aim to give people an opportunity to choose food that is mostly raw  and organic (where possible).  With all the scienctific information that is availible one would start to wonder.  Why is the world so full of Junk food?  Where is the good value wholesome food that we need to live healthy lives?
